I currently offer consultancy services on the adoption of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude (amongst others), specialising in smaller organisations without much in-house technical expertise.

Below are a few commonly-requested services. For a quote or to discuss bespoke services, get in touch at contact@adamparnaby.com

## Introduction to Generative AI Workshop

### What is this?
A 3-hour workshop covering the basics of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.

### Who is this for?
Small and medium-sized organisations with an interest in making use of off the shelf generative AI and little to no in-house AI expertise.

### What are the expected outputs?
This introductory workshop will support attendees to:
- Understand what generative AI tools are and a nontechnical explanation of how they work.
- Know about common tools on the market and their relative merits.
- Develop a critical perspective on the limitations of generative AI tools and the risks adopting them may pose.
- Understand a few common, effective, and low-risk use cases.
- Get hands-on experience with some of the most common generative AI tools in a supportive and low-stakes environment.

Presentation slides will also be provided for internal use. Clients may record the workshop for internal use if they wish.

## AI Policy Development Workshop

### What is this?
A 3-hour workshop for around 6 people from an organisation, intended to facilitate discussion on the content of an organisational usage policy for Generative AI tools.

Following an initial conversation with the client about their organisation to tailor content, the workshop will support participants to consider what topics should be covered by their policy, and to take a stance on generative AI use that meets their organisational values.

### Who is this for?
Organisations that are looking to develop a usage policy for the use of off the shelf generative AI products, either for internal use or to make a public-facing commitment.

I recommend this workshop as a follow-up to Introduction to Generative AI unless an organisation already has substantial AI expertise in-house.

### What are the expected outputs?
This workshop will facilitate a frank and honest conversation between attendees as to the structure and content of an AI policy that meets their organisational values.

A summary of the agreed structure and content will be provided after the workshop.

The workshop may be recorded at the clientâ€™s discretion.

Please note that I am not able to offer full written policy documents at this time. This workshop should be viewed as support for an organisation to write their own policy as appropriately as possible.
