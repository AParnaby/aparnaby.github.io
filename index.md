title: Hi!

I'm Adam, and I do design, user research, and teaching people how to do design and user research. 

I specialise in digital access - meaning I try to ask and answer questions about how the benefits of digital technology can be made accessible to a diverse range of people, regardless of their personal circumstances. I'm particularly interested in how technology can be designed to meet the needs of people who don't have conventional "digital skills".

Details of my projects can be found in the sections at the top of this page.

If you are interested in getting involved in my academic research, you can contact me at [a.w.parnaby2@newcastle.ac.uk](mailto:a.w.parnaby2@newcastle.ac.uk).

If you would like to inquire about freelance user research work, or having me speak at your organisation or event, please instead use [contact@adamparnaby.com](mailto:contact@adamparnaby.com).
